# DSP---Edge-Detection-RGB-Gray-Scale-IDFT-DFT
This project was to write software that uses most of the principals within Digital Signal Process which involved edge detection filters using Sobel Algorithm, Gray Scale, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) &amp; IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform).
