# DSP---Edge-Detection-RGB-Gray-Scale-IDFT-DFT
This project was to write software that uses most of the principals within Digital Signal Process which involved edge detection filters using Sobel Algorithm, Gray Scale, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) &amp; IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform).

This Project was compiled using the Qt Framework (Qt5 - The latest version currently). Included is a detailed report of how the above problem statent was solved, if you wish to understand the implementations of this project l highly recommend reading the Detailed Report PDF.
